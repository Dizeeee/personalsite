                <p>Hi, my name is Jack Malcom. I am currently a freshman computer science major at the University of Arkansas. As you might be able to tell, I'm still doing this part of the website. I like doing most of my styling by hand so I have lighter pages when I'm done. Hopefully this one doesn't look too terrible when I finish it. If you're on desktop right now then this probably doesn't look too bad, but trust me, mobile is totally broken.</p>
